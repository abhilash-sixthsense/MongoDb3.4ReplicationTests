Instead of empty init always init with the sharding id like below
rs.initiate(
   {
      _id: "myrepl",
      version: 1,
      members: [
         { _id: 0, host : "repl1:27017" },
         { _id: 1, host : "repl2:27017" },
         { _id: 2, host : "repl3:27017" }
      ]
   }
)


if only secondary is available, both read and write will not be possible

if there are more than one node up, one will be elected as primary, the criteria for election is unknown , the current behaviour is like a round robin

useful commands
docker ps

docker stop <containername> ,

docker stop repl2
docker start repl2

docker-compose up
docker-compose down

clean.sh is for cleaning the images and containers

TODO

Tomorrow try this with a fastapi code
Run python code also in a docker container
    move test.py to another dir
        pythonclient
        give a build file there
